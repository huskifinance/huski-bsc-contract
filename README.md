# What is Huski Finance Lab
    Huski Finance Lab is an ecosystem of DeFi products that will interoperate to maximize returns while minimizing risks for users. Huski products focus on capturing unaddressed demand in DeFi in an innovative and user-friendly way.
    Each Huski product will address market gaps and problems in the sector the product is in. The various Huski products will then work together to achieve the overarching theme of maximizing returns for users while offering a synergistic solution to minimize downside exposure/risk. This focus underpins the opportunities we choose to evaluate and the decisions we make. As we cannot capture every opportunity, we focus on only the ones that have clear unaddressed demand and market gaps to bring synergy to the Huski ecosystem. By doing so, we will be able to thrive and dominate in such verticals, continue to disrupt the industry, and bring a superior value proposition compared to existing solutions in the market.
